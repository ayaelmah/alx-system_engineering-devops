## üêæ Issue Summary
- **Duration:** August 15, 2024, 14:30 - 17:00 UTC
- **Impact:** Our beloved game "Fetch Frenzy" turned into an epic fail as the dog character decided to nap instead of running and jumping. Approximately 70% of our players were left scratching their heads and hitting reload. Additionally, front-end users were not thrilled with the game‚Äôs outdated colors and styles, which made the game look like it was stuck in the '90s.
- **Root Cause:** A mischievous JavaScript bug that turned our energetic dog into a couch potato, combined with outdated CSS that made the game look like a relic from an ancient web era.
